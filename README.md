## Welcome to The Agile Projects Challenge in 300 days 

### INTRODUCTION

The scope of this challenge is to use Agile methodologies to achieve medium-long term projects/goals or habits.
You can push yourself to do things that you wouldn’t do for a short period of time, but you cannot force yourself forever without to risk a mental or a physical burnout.  
I have developed this challenge for people that have not to much time to work on their development or pet project because they have a full-time job or other duties that don’t allow them to spend a lot of hours on a full-time project.

The Idea about this challenge came to me after I wrote my post about The startup agile transformation on LinkedIn[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-schr%C3%B6dingers-cat-paradox-massimiliano-sermi/]. I thought about how I could create a lightweight agile framework for personal development transformation based on SMART goals and iterative empirical processes.  
In  this way, people will be able to understand what is working for them, what is not working adapt and change until they get a constant pace to develop themselves

Because I like working with agile methodologies I thought to create a long-term challenge to bring value to people lives focusing on long terms goals but working in an iterative way to see the progress sprint after sprint.

This challenge is also a good hands-on practice exercise to understand how agile works and how agile practices could be applied to every situation and not just in software development
Nonetheless, because this challenge can be accomplished in solo mode, I have made up, in the rules of play, a lightweight version of 
Scrum as a framework.

That said if this challenge can also be accomplished in groups or in organizations as a pet project or teams activities. 
If this is the case you can still use the lightweight version or, if you have experience, you can use a completely different agile framework, and adapt it to your needs or projects.

### RULES OF PLAY

- Fork the project and make it public.
- Create a README.MD file on that you will write the date in which you started the challenge, the scope, the person involved, if there are, the roles if there are and everything else you think is worth mention.
- Take some time before starting the challenge to plan about the milestones/projects that you want to accomplish and keep it very generic.
- Set a date for these milestones, if you don’t have an idea about it keep the 300 days as a deadline.
- Create user stories and link it to the milestone(we can use issues in GitHub to create user stories and label them as user stories).
- Use this format to describe the user story "as a <type of user> I want to < do something > so that <I can archieve something>.
- Add acceptance criteria as a checklist to the user stories, these will represent the tasks to be completed to match the definition of done. When all those checklists are marked the user story can be considered done (You can add checklist in GitHub with this syntax - [ ]).
- Put as final acceptance criteria the result obtained by completing the user story, it can be a photo, it can be a link to a certificate it can be a list of exercises complete correctly or anything else that can show your archived result.
- After create a project with 4 columns:
  - Project backlog 
  - Sprint to do 
  - In progress 
  - Done
- Add the user's stories you have created in the backlog column, this will represent your initial commitment for the 300 days challenge. Keep in mind that the backlog is a living creature, so it might be possible that you will remove users stories from there or that you will add more user stories or milestones as soon as the challenge goes on.
- After that think carefully about how many of these user stories you will be able to complete in a sprint(2 weeks). 
  - Not worry at the beginning you won’t be able to understand correctly how many user stories or tasks you will be able to  accomplish because more you will work iteratively, more you will learn about your speed and you will learn to chose every time the right amount of user stories.
- When all this is done you can start the challenge and start working on the sprint user stories.
- Every day before starting working on the challenge you have to take 5 minutes to do a daily stand up to answer yourself these 3 questions:
 - What I did yesterday(and check the tasks done or move the user story accomplished)
 - On what I commit to dotoday(Move the user story in progress)
 - What can block my commits (This is mainly for you to think forward if you will face some problem related to your personal life or whatnot and plan accordingly to remove this issues)
- Start working using the Pomodoro technique, 25 minutes of focused work than 5-minute pause repeat this process as many time as you want. 
  - Be sure you are in quiet place and that all your annoying devices and notifications are turned off (email, messages, tv, etc., you can check those later in the 5-minute break).
- At the end of the sprint (2 weeks) have 15 minutes to review the work done, what you have accomplished or completed, update the board or write it in the README
  - Celebrate what you have accomplished giving to you a reward, everything that is enjoyable for you, celebrate also a failure if you have understood what went wrong and how to fix it.
- After the review has a retrospective,take 25 minutes to think about what went wrong and well during the sprint:
  - why you weren't able to complete what you have planned or why you were able to complete everything. 
  - How do you feel about it? 
  - Did someone help you? Or blocked you? 
  - Did you overcommit? 
  - Were you motivated enough, if not why? 
   - try to write down the lesson learned to improve them in the next sprint, write kudos to yourself or to who helped you. (you can mention people on GitHubwith this symbol @)
- After that take 10 minutes pause and take 1 hour to plan the next sprint.
- Repeat this iteration every sprint
  
### Q&A

- Q: Why are we using Github?
 - A: GitHub is a free project management tool that is really handy because it comes with a lot of built-in tools like the project board. It comes with the possibility to create the milestone, labels, issues that can be added directly to the project. Everything can be linked to create paths and dependencies. 
Github is primarily used for software development but it can be used for many other things, like a simple project management tool.
Last but not least, GitHub has a huge community, people can easily follow you, track your progress, help with tasks if you allow them, give suggestions, use your same project if they like just forking it.
And very important progress can be tracked via repository, branches etc. so, there is no way for a person to try to cheat himself.

- Q: Can we use a different project management tool?
 - A: Yes, of course, you can! But most of them offer not a complete experience without paying. 
On top of that, it won’t be easy for other to check your accomplishment or give help and that can bring you to not feel the peer pressure.

- Q: Does anyone need my password to follow or work on my project?
 - A: Absolutely not! no one needs your password for anything. Never give your password around, just be sure to make your repository public and give the possibility to other to comment or help you in the settings.
 
 - Q: Do I need to have a complete list of the project I want to do before starting the challenge?
  - A: Absolutely not! As I said you need just a starting point, after that you can always add new projects, user stories, tasks at the end of each sprint in the sprint planning or day by day grooming the project backlog when you have time.
  
- Q: Is this a real agile framework?
 - A: Absolutely not! This is a lightweight framework that I made up. It has taken some ceremonies from scrum framework but those have been adopted. This will give you a glimpse about how agile works but to have an official training you should join or check out some worldwide recognized organization such as ScrumAlliance [https://www.scrumalliance.org/].
